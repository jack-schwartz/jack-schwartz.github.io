            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
Taking place within Southeastern New Hampshire's geographical expanse, this project is an exploration of the interplay between railroads and pollution. A mapping analysis is conducted to reveal the combined impact of these factors, exploring the cost-benefit  of railroads, marked by supply-chain advancement and ecological implications. The project extends beyond web mapping as it delves into the global significance of railroads and their environmental implications. It synthesizes mapping railroads and local climate understanding to understand pollution in Southeastern New Hampshire further.

        <section id="global-significance">
            <h2>Global Significance of Railroads and Pollution</h2>
            <p>The global railroad system presents a mixed environmental impact. Rail transport is often more energy-efficient and emits fewer pollutants than road or air travel. Nonetheless, challenges exist, including habitat disruption during construction, noise and vibration concerns, and potential land use changes. These environmental drawbacks can be tempered through sustainable practices, adopting renewable energy sources, and adhering to stringent regulations.
            </P>
            <br></br>
            <p>
While not without its environmental concerns, railroads offer a comparatively greener transportation option. Their efficiency and potential for reduced emissions make them a vital part of addressing transportation's environmental impact. Balancing benefits and challenges, strategic approaches can harness railroads' potential to contribute to a more environmentally responsible global transportation network.
